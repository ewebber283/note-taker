# note-taker
Purpose
Note Taker allows you to take notes, save them, and later view them.


Built With
HTML

CSS

JavaScript

Express Backend

Improvements:
The app does not have the ability to retrieve notes when clicked on-it just saves them to the side. When using insomnia you can retrieve and see the notes using a get request-this needs to added to the note taker app itself to have it function at its best. There are also two notes created whenever one is saved and needs to be debugged further.
